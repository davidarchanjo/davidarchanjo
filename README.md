# ü§ì Introduction 
I am a professional with 12+ years of activity in the software development industry. My experience comes mostly from working with Java projects using the Spring Boot framework for backend development, and with Node.js web projects using the Angular framework for frontend development and JavaScript/TypeScript for the backend. I also have extensive hands-on experience in tasks like modeling, manipulation and integration of SQL and NoSQL databases; containerization of applications; serverless application development on AWS; and DevOps practices such as CI/CD pipeline, IaC, observability, monitoring.
