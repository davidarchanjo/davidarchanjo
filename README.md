# 🤓 Introduction 
I am Brazilian, proudly addicted to coffee ☕, who doesn't huh!?, and father of two beautiful little girls 👶👧. As a professional software engineer, I have been working with SDLC for over 12 years — still biting my nails when coding gets nesty 😌. Lately I'm working a lot on activities related to cloud development and DevOps routines, seeking to specialize myself in the best practices and most productive ways of construction and architecture of microservices and containers targeting Java applications backed by the Spring Framework — with a special attention on new technologies and frameworks optimized for modern cloud-native Java applications like [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) and [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/).
