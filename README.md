# ðŸ¤“ Introduction 
I am Brazilian and as a professional software engineer, I have been working with software development for over 12 years and more recently focused on activities related to cloud development (specifically to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)) and DevOps. I have been seeking to specialize myself in the best practices of construction and architecture of microservices and containers targeting Java applications backed by the Spring Framework and with a special attention on new technologies and frameworks optimized for the Cloud, like [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) e [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/).
