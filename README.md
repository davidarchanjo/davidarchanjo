# 🤓 Introduction 
I am Brazilian, proudly addicted to coffee and father of two beautiful little girls. As a professional software engineer, I have been working with SDLC for over 12 years and still biting my nails when coding gets nesty 😌. In the last recent years I am working on activities related to cloud development (specifically to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)) and DevOps routines. I have been seeking to specialize myself in the best practices of construction and architecture of microservices and containers targeting Java applications backed by the Spring Framework, having a special attention to new technologies and frameworks optimized for modern cloud-native Java applications like [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) and [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/).
