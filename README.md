# ðŸ¤“ Introduction 
I am Brazilian, proudly addicted to coffee â˜•, who doesn't huh!?, and father of two beautiful little girls ðŸ‘¶ðŸ‘§. As a professional software engineer, I have been working with SDLC for over 12 years and have recently being involved in activities related to cloud-driven development and DevOps routines, always focused on specializing myself in the best practices and most productive ways to build and architect applications â€” mostly in Java combined with the Spring Framework ecosystem. I have also been following with great enthusiasm the arising and evolution of new technologies optimized for the cloud that use new generations of the JVM, such as [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) and [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/).
